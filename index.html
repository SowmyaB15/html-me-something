            <ol id="list-text">
                <a name = "ghee"></a>
                    <li class = "list-items">Desi Ghee</li>
	                    <img src = "images/ghee.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p> Ghee has been used in India for centuries. Of late, however, the rest of the world is following suit and 
                        applauding desi ghee for its magnificent properties. Ghee may be high in fat but recent lab studies have 
                        shown that daily consumption of ghee (in adequate quantities) can help reduce blood cholesterol. 
                        It is also rich in antioxidants and acts as an aid for the absorption of vitamins and minerals from other 
                        foods, thereby boosting digestive health. As a rich source of butyric acid, ghee also helps in lowering
                        inflammation and boosts immunity.</p>
                <a name = "amla"></a>
                    <li class = "list-items">Indian Gooseberry</li>
                        <img src = "images/amla.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p> Indian gooseberry, or amla, is a rich source of natural vitamin C, with a concentration of 600 mg to 1800 mg
                        of ascorbic acid in every 100 g. Fresh amla juice contains 20 times as much vitamin C as is present in orange
                        juice. Heating or drying of fresh fruits or vegetables can cause the loss of most of the vitamin C present 
                        originally. However, amla is an exception as it contains substances that partially protect the vitamin from 
                        being destroyed during heating or drying.</p>
                <a name = "haldi"></a>                
                    <li class = "list-items">Haldi</li>
                        <img src = "images/turmeric.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p> Haldi, or Turmeric, is used in Indian cuisine to spice up dals and curries. But did you know that besides being
                        a key ingredient in cooking, turmeric has also a special place in Indian medicine? Curcumin, the active component
                        in turmeric, is credited for its numerous health benefits. It is known to help with inflammatory disorders, 
                        irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis as well as for eye and skin conditions and neurological disorders. 
                        Turmeric is a natural antiseptic and anti-bacterial agent that can be used to fight infections. In fact, a very 
                        effective remedy for the common cold is to mix a pinch of turmeric powder in a glass of warm milk and have it 
                        before going to bed.</p>
                <a name = "ragi"></a>                
                    <li class = "list-items">Ragi</li>
                        <img src = "images/ragi.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p> Ragi, also known as Finger millet is a super grain. It contains all 3 parts of kernel namely bran, germ, and 
                        endosperm which are extremely beneficial for health. This cereal is gluten free so it is highly preferred by 
                        gluten and lactose intolerant people. Rich in Vitamin D and iron, Ragi regulates the blood sugar levels and 
	                    also helps in reducing the risk of stroke. It is a natural relaxant and helps in reducing weight as well.</p>
                <a name = "moringa"></a>             
                    <li class = "list-items">Moringa</li>
                        <img src = "images/moringa.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p> Moringa(Drumstick) is an incredible nutrient-dense superfood! It has seven times the amount of vitamin C in oranges,
                        four times as much calcium and double the amount of protein in milk, four times the vitamin A in carrots, and three 
                        times the potassium in bananas! In fact, moringa tree leaves registered a higher ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) 
                        score (157,000!) than most anitoxidant superfoods that are traditionally talked about, including Acai berries, green tea,
                        blueberries, dark chocolate, garlic, goji berries, pomegranates and red wine! In places where no one can afford fancy 
                        pharmaceuticals, moringa trees keep people healthy. One nickname for it is “vitamin tree” – with good reason! 
                        It is not uncommon to see people reaching up and pulling the young leaves off moringa tress and chewing on them. 
                        Getting a fresh burst of vitamins and nutrients in the single handful.</p>
                <a name = "makhana"></a>
                    <li class = "list-items">Makhana</li>
                        <img src = "images/makhana.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p> Makhanas are a popular snack which becomes more popular during fasts. Puffed up like cotton balls, lotus seed or makhana 
                        possess several health benefits. They are low in fat, high in protein, iron, magnesium, possession, and zinc. Makhanas are 
                        also believed to heal the stressed mind and help in curing insomnia. This superfood from India also contributes to improving
                        urination and possesses anti-aging properties.</p>
                <a name = "jackfruit"></a>
                    <li class = "list-items">Jackfruit</li>
                        <img src = "images/jackfruit.jpg" class = "image"/>
	                    <p>Jackfruit, which is packed with many minerals and vitamins, is one of a kind. It is a rich source of carbohydrate, vitamins, 
                        protein, fiber, electrolytes, and phytonutrients. It is a rich source of simple sugar ( fructose and sucrose) which provides
                        instant energy. Jackfruit is also rich in dietary fats which helps in improved digestion and prevents constipation. 
                        Not only this, it has high anti-toxicant content. This superfood is scaling the health food popularity chart these days as 
                        it helps in reducing weight and cholesterol, beat diabetes and also prevent colon cancer.</p>
